<h2>YOUTUBE CREATOR</h2>
<p> YouTuber refers to personal uploaders who work on YouTube, a free online video sharing site. Anyone can become a YouTuber with a Google account. If more than 1,000 subscribers and more than 4,000 hours of open viewing time over the past 12 months, they can earn profits through advertising. In addition, even if you create a single Google account, you can add unlimited channels on YouTube, so one famous YouTuber often runs multiple channels.</p>
